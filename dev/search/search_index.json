It targets the last mile of the publication process: The creation of a publication from raw research results.</p> <p>The making of a scientific publication involves many moving parts, which are not easily connected and shared among co-authors. Raw results need to be analyzed, tabulated, and plotted and presented in a convenient way to the reader. Today, such data processing is increasingly done using scripting languages (Python, R, Notebooks, \u2026) because they allow more advanced analysis than spreadsheets or manual calculations. Too often, however, the results of such scripting tools are incorporated into a publication (or subsequent analysis tool) by tedious copy-paste or manual import. While each tool can be very advanced, the transfer of information from one step to the next is often not. This becomes problematic in at least the following scenarios:</p> <ol> <li> <p>When trying to reproduce the results of a paper, long after it was published,    you may not remember how intermediate results were transferred between different analysis tools    and how these results were transformed into a presentable form in the publication.    In such situations, published results are not easily reproducible.    (They may still be formally reproducible, given an almost infinite amount of time and coffee.)</p> </li> <li> <p>If a small error in one of the analysis scripts is fixed,    at least a part of the analysis must be repeated.    Every step after the fixed part and all data transfers between them must also be repeated.    Especially if such fixes occur regularly in the writing process,    the repetitive analysis and data transfers become very error-prone,    which undermines the quality of the publication.</p> </li> <li> <p>Because at least one person needs to know how to get data into and out of an analysis tool,    the raw data and scripts will primarily reside on that person\u2019s computer or account.    Even if the data and scripts are archived and made available,    the knowledge of how to reproduce these results is not easily shared.</p> </li> </ol> <p>StepUp RepRep overcomes these difficulties by fully formalizing the interactions between different scripts, analysis tools and authoring software. Once configured, the entire process, from raw results and source files all the way to a ZIP file to be uploaded to the publisher, can be reproduced by simply running the <code>stepup</code> program once.</p>"},{"location":"#git-and-virtual-environments","title":"Git and Virtual Environments","text":"<p>A project produced with StepUp RepRep uses the following technologies to further facilitate data management and reproducibility:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The entire publication source,   along with all analysis scripts necessary to generate final tables and figures,   is developed in a Git repository.

However, their reliability alone does not make them suitable for long-term archival:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An online Git platform is typically provided by a single company.

With StepUp, you can easily regenerate all results and PDFs from these sources,   so storing them in Git is not strictly necessary.

As a result, output is generally not archived in a Git repository.</p> <p>This is not a problem while you are working on a publication, as you are constantly using StepUp (or another tool) to build the outputs. However, if you are taking data from an old archive, regenerating the output from the sources can be a challenge.

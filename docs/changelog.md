## [1.4.0] - 2024-08-27 {: #v1.4.0 }

### Added

  It converts paths from SVG files back into data,
  which can be used to reverse-engineer data sets from plots.

### Changed

- Move `load_module_file` from StepUp Core to `stepup.reprep.render`
  and improve it to facilitate local imports.


## [1.3.0] - 2024-06-28 {: #v1.3.0 }

### Added

- The script `reprep-sync-zenodo` and corresponding StepUp API function `sync_zenodo()`
  synchronize your local data with a draft dataset on Zenodo.
- Small documentation updates

### Fixed

- Upgraded dependency markdown-katex to version 202406.1035
  and enabled concurrency for markdown conversion with equations.
- Scrub PDF files after opening them with `fitz`.
  See https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF/issues/3635


## [1.2.1] - 2024-05-27 {: #v1.2.1 }

### Changed

- Conversion from HTML to weasyprint is now a two-step process and includes detection
  of implicit input files used in the HTML to PDF conversion. (Images and exteral CCS)
- Improved reusability of script modules:
  `add_notes_pdf`, `check_hrefs`, `convert_inkscape`, `convert_markdown`,
  `convert_weasyprint`, `latex`, `latex_flat`, `make_inventory`, `normalized_pdf`,
  `nup_pdf`, `raster_pdf`, `render` and `zip_inventory`.

### Fixed

- Fixed a few errors in the HTML generated by `convert_markdown()`


## [1.2.0] - 2024-05-20 {: #v1.2.0 }

### Added

- `reprep-zip-inventory` command to manually create a reproducible ZIP file from an `inventory.txt` file.
- More documentation on how to work with inventory files.
- Tutorial for archiving StepUp publication Git repositories.

### Changed

- Renamed all `MANIFEST` and `manifest` occurrences to `inventory`
  and removed dependency of setuptools for processing such files.
- The API of `make_inventory` is made simpler than that of `make_manifest`.
- The commands supported in `inventory.def` files now differ from those in setuptools:
  `include`, `exclude`, `include-git`, `exclude-git`, `include-workflow` and `exclude-workflow`.
- The css style has been made customizable in `convert_markdown`.
- KaTeX is now optional in `convert_markdown`.

### Fixed

- An error message is raised when trying to a put a directory in an inventory file.
- Symbolic links are no longer dereferenced when they are listed in an inventory file.
- Symbolic links are archived in ZIP files without dereferencing.

  (with `SELF_CALL=x`).

## [1.1.1] - 2024-05-07 {: #v1.1.1 }

### Fixed

  thanks to the workaround posted here:

- Libroffice PDF conversion now works also in parallel,
  thanks to the workaround posted here:
  https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106134

  which triggered the watcher of StepUp Core.

# Developer Notes

If you would like to contribute, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/reproducible-reporting/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How to Make Releases

- Mark the release in `changelog.md`.
- Make a new commit and tag it with `vX.Y.Z`.
- Trigger the PyPI GitHub Action: `git push origin main --tags`.


## Development Install and Unit Tests

First, create a [StepUp Core development installation](https://reproducible-reporting.github.io/stepup-core/development/).
The following commands assume you create `stepup-core` and `step-reprep` source trees as subdirectories of the same parent.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:reproducible-reporting/stepup-reprep.git
cd stepup-reprep
pre-commit install
python -m venv venv
echo 'source venv/bin/activate' > .envrc
direnv allow
pip install -U pip
pip install -e .[dev]
pip install -e ../stepup-core
pytest -vv
```

## Documentation

The documentation is created with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Edit the documentation markdown files with a live preview by running:

```bash
mkdocs serve --watch stepup/reprep/
```

(Keep this running.)
Then open the live preview in your browser: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

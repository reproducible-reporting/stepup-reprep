# Working on a Project

## The `stepup` Program and `plan.py`

We strongly recommend that you follow the [StepUp Core "Getting Started" tutorials](https://reproducible-reporting.github.io/stepup-core/getting_started/introduction/),
to familiarize yourself with the `stepup` program.
This is the build tool that orchestrates the processing of results and the compilation of the paper.
These tutorials will give you a good understanding of how StepUp works and how to use it.

Now that you have gained a basic understanding of StepUp Core,
it will become clear why a `plan.py` file is included in the template.
The off-the-shelf `plan.py` already covers quite a few use cases,
but consider it a good starting point for further development.
In addition to the functions in `stepup.core.api`, StepUp RepRep provides more functionality geared towards scientific publishing.
Reference documentation for these functions can be found here:

- [stepup.reprep.api][]
- [stepup.reprep.tile_pdf][]


## Git

Aside from making small changes, working on a StepUp project can greatly benefit from basic Git skills.
If you are new to Git, start with small steps and take on bigger challenges as you gain experience.

### Keep Clean

It is essential to keep the Git repository organized and understandable by your co-authors.
When in doubt, ask one of your co-authors to review before making a commit.

The project template uses  [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) to clean up trivial annoyances.
Ensure you have installed `pre-commit` and activated it on your clone of the repository.

To remove all stale files (defined in `.gitignore`), run `git clean -dfX`.
However, do not use this command until you have committed all important files,
as it may inadvertently remove work in progress.

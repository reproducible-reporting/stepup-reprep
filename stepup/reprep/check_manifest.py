"""Checking of MANIFEST files.

There are two kinds of MANIFEST files:

- ``MANIFEST.in`` contains rules to select or ignore files to be included into an archive.
- ``MANIFEST.txt`` is the result of a processing a ``MANIFEST.in`` file with this script.
  It contains every individual file, together with its size in bytes and its blake2b hexdigest.
